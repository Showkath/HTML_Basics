  <!-- When to Use Paragraph and Div -->
  <h2>When to Use Paragraph and Div</h2>
  <p>Use <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> when you have text content that forms a coherent block or paragraph.</p>
  <p>Use <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> when you need a generic container to group other elements together or create complex layouts.</p>
  <p>Always strive to use semantic elements like <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> for better accessibility and document structure.</p>
  <p>Use <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> sparingly and purposefully for styling and layout purposes.</p>
